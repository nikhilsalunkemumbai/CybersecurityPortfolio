  - event: "Testing"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Tool built successfully. Tested with `-l -v` arguments, confirmed successful enumeration and reporting of installed software."
  - event: "Completed"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Tool is fully implemented, documented, and tested according to portfolio requirements, as a Proof of Concept."

    version: "1.0.1"
    notes: "Tool's code validated against `PROGRAMMING_STANDARDS` and `SHARED_ABSTRACTIONS_CHECKLIST`. All standards met, including <=300 lines of code. Confirmed usage of `System.CommandLine` and `Microsoft.Win32.Registry` for Windows-specific functionality."

# --- Shared Abstractions Application ---
shared_abstractions:
  cli_argument_parsing:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use `System.CommandLine` or manual parsing for consistent CLI flags: -l (list all), -f (filter by name), -o (output file), -v (verbose)."
  error_handling_exit_codes:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will exit with 0 on success, non-zero on access errors, invalid arguments, or enumeration issues. Errors printed to stderr."
  logging_output_format:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use [INFO] and [ERROR] prefixes for verbose output to stderr/console, consistent with guide."
  testing_methodology_structure:
    applied: false
    notes: "Manual testing on a Windows system to verify accurate enumeration and filtering of installed software."
  declarative_tool_metadata:
    applied: true
    notes: "Tool description and usage will be in the `README.md` and also as comments/doc-comments in the C# `Program.cs` file. Aligns with intent of a metadata block."
  how_it_relates_doc:
    applied: false
    notes: "N/A - This is a Phase 1 tool, not Phase 0."
