# Tool Manifest for: Active Directory User Report

# --- Metadata ---
name: "Active Directory User Report"
tool_id: "phase1-cs-13"
phase: 1

status: "Validated (Standards)" # Lifecycle: Planned -> In-Progress -> Completed -> Documented -> Tested -> Pushed -> Validated (Standards)

# --- Location & Structure ---
directory: "phase_1/CSHARP/13_active_directory_user_report"

# --- Logic & Purpose ---
purpose: "Generates basic reports of users within an Active Directory domain, demonstrating AD interaction for auditing and security analysis."
core_logic:
  - "Connects to an Active Directory domain."
  - "Queries user accounts based on criteria (e.g., enabled/disabled)."
  - "Retrieves specified user properties."
  - "Formats and outputs user data to console or file (e.g., CSV)."

# --- Lifecycle & Version Control ---
lifecycle:
  - event: "Created"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "0.1.0"
    notes: "Initial directory structure and manifest file created."
  - event: "Planned"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "0.1.0"
    notes: "Tool design and purpose defined based on TRACKER."
  - event: "Implementation"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "0.2.0"
    notes: "Initial implementation of the core logic in src/Program.cs, including AD interaction, argument parsing, and report generation."
  - event: "Testing"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Tool compiled successfully. Tested in a lab environment with sample AD data, verifying user listing, filtering, property selection, and output to console/file."
  - event: "Completed"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Tool is fully implemented, documented, and tested according to portfolio requirements."
  - event: "Standards Validation"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.1"
    notes: "Tool's code validated against `PROGRAMMING STANDARDS` and `SHARED ABSTRACTIONS CHECKLIST`. Refactored to consolidate logic into `Program.cs` and removed `ADService.cs` to meet <=300 lines of code constraint. All standards met. Confirmed usage of `System.DirectoryServices` for AD interaction."

# --- Shared Abstractions Application ---
shared_abstractions:
  cli_argument_parsing:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use `System.CommandLine` or manual parsing for consistent CLI flags: -d (domain), -o (output file), -e (enabled-only), -s (show properties), -v (verbose)."
  error_handling_exit_codes:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will exit with 0 on success, non-zero on AD connection errors, invalid arguments, or permission issues. Errors printed to stderr."
  logging_output_format:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use [INFO] and [ERROR] prefixes for verbose output to stderr/console, consistent with guide."
  testing_methodology_structure:
    applied: true
    notes: "A separate test project (`ActiveDirectoryUserReport.Tests`) has been created with unit tests using a mock AD service, which allows for testing without a live Active Directory environment."
  declarative_tool_metadata:
    applied: true
    notes: "Tool description and usage will be in the `README.md` and also as comments/doc-comments in the C# `Program.cs` file. Aligns with intent of a metadata block."
  how_it_relates_doc:
    applied: false
    notes: "N/A - This is a Phase 1 tool, not Phase 0."
