# --- Logic & Purpose ---
purpose: "Parses Windows Event Logs to summarize key security events, errors, or anomalies."
core_logic:
  - "Connects to local or remote Windows Event Logs."
  - "Filters events based on criteria (e.g., event ID, source, time range, level)."
  - "Aggregates and summarizes events."
  - "Outputs a concise report (e.g., count of specific event IDs, critical errors per hour)."

# --- Lifecycle & Version Control ---
lifecycle:
  - event: "Created"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "0.1.0"
    notes: "Initial directory structure and manifest file created."
  - event: "Planned"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "0.1.0"
    notes: "Tool design and purpose defined based on TRACKER.md."
  - event: "Implementation"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "0.2.0"
    notes: "Initial C# code for argument parsing, basic event log query, and time range parsing in src/Program.cs."
  - event: "Testing"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Tool built successfully (after fixing missing package reference and casting issue). Tested with 'Application' log and verbose output, confirmed successful summarization."
  - event: "Completed"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Tool is fully implemented, documented, and tested according to portfolio requirements, as a Proof of Concept."
  - event: "Standards Validation"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.1"
    notes: "Tool's code validated against `PROGRAMMING_STANDARDS.md` and `SHARED_ABSTRACTIONS_CHECKLIST.md`. All standards met, including <=300 lines of code. Confirmed usage of `System.CommandLine`, `System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader`, and `System.Diagnostics.EventLog` for Windows-specific functionality."

# --- Shared Abstractions Application ---
shared_abstractions:
  cli_argument_parsing:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use `System.CommandLine` or manual parsing for consistent CLI flags: -l (log name), -f (filter), -t (time range), -o (output file), -v (verbose)."
  error_handling_exit_codes:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will exit with 0 on success, non-zero on event log access errors, invalid arguments, or parsing issues. Errors printed to stderr."
  logging_output_format:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use [INFO] and [ERROR] prefixes for verbose output to stderr/console, consistent with guide."
  testing_methodology_structure:
    applied: false
    notes: "Manual testing with sample event logs (or simulated logs) will be performed. A formal test suite might be considered if complexity warrants."
  declarative_tool_metadata:
    applied: true
    notes: "Tool description and usage will be in the `README.md` and also as comments/doc-comments in the C# `Program.cs` file. Aligns with intent of a metadata block."
  how_it_relates_doc:
    applied: false
    notes: "N/A - This is a Phase 1 tool, not Phase 0."
