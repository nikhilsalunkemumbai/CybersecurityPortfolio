# --- Shared Abstractions Application ---
shared_abstractions:
  cli_argument_parsing:
    applied: true
    notes: "Uses Go's `flag` package for consistent CLI flags: -h, -p, -i, -o, -t, -w, -v."
  error_handling_exit_codes:
    applied: true
    notes: "Exits with 0 on success, 1 on errors like file not found or TLS connection failures. Prints errors to stderr."

    applied: true
    notes: "Uses [INFO] and [ERROR] prefixes for verbose output to stderr, consistent with guide."
  testing_methodology_structure:
    applied: true
    notes: "Manual testing performed with sample input/output, demonstrating functionality."
  declarative_tool_metadata:
    applied: true
    notes: "Tool description and usage are in the `README.md` and also as comments in the Go file. Aligns with intent of a metadata block."
