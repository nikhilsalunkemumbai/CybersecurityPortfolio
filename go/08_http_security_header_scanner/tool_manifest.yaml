# --- Shared Abstractions Application ---
shared_abstractions:
  cli_argument_parsing:
    applied: true
    notes: "Uses Go's `flag` package for consistent CLI flags: -u, -i, -o, -t, -v."
  error_handling_exit_codes:
    applied: true
    notes: "Exits with 0 on success, 1 on errors like invalid arguments or HTTP request failures. Prints errors to stderr."
  logging_output_format:
    applied: true
    notes: "Uses [INFO] and [ERROR] prefixes for verbose output to stderr, consistent with guide."
  testing_methodology_structure:
    applied: true
    notes: "Manual testing performed with sample input/output, demonstrating single and multiple URL scanning."
  declarative_tool_metadata:
    applied: true
    notes: "Tool description and usage are in the `README.md` and also as comments in the Go file. Aligns with intent of a metadata block."
  how_it_relates_doc:
    applied: false
    notes: "N/A - This is a Phase 1 tool, not Phase 0."
