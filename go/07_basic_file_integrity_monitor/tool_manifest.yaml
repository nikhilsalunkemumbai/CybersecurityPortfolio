# --- Metadata ---
name: "Basic File Integrity Monitor"
tool_id: "phase1-go-07"
phase: 1
category: "Go"
language: "Go"
version: "0.1.0"
status: "Validated (Standards)" # Lifecycle: Planned -> In-Progress -> Completed -> Documented -> Tested -> Pushed -> Validated (Standards)

# --- Location & Structure ---
directory: "phase_1/GO/07_basic_file_integrity_monitor"

# --- Logic & Purpose ---
purpose: "Generates and verifies cryptographic hashes for files to detect unauthorized modifications."
core_logic:
  - "Generates SHA256 hashes for a given set of files/directories."
  - "Stores these hashes as a baseline (JSON format)."
  - "Compares current file hashes against a baseline to identify changed, added, or deleted files."

    version: "0.2.5"
    notes: "Retesting after path resolution fixes. Confirmed all integrity scenarios (OK, MODIFIED, DELETED) work."
  - event: "Reintroduce Short Flags"
    date: "2026-01-30"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Reintroduced short CLI flags (`-i`, `-o`, `-v`) as primary identifiers in flag definitions."
  - event: "Retesting - Short Flags"
    date: "2026-01-30"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Confirmed all integrity scenarios work with short flags."
  - event: "Completed - Initial Version"
    date: "2026-01-30"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Tool fully implemented, documented, and tested according to portfolio requirements (initial `main.go`)."
  - event: "Optimization & Standards Validation"
    date: "2026-01-30"
    version: "1.0.1"
    notes: "Implemented `main_optimized_v2.go` to meet <=300 line constraint. Code validated against `PROGRAMMING_STANDARDS.md` for Go, including time/space complexity analysis (O(N*F) time, O(N) space). Functional tests re-verified."

# --- Shared Abstractions Application ---
shared_abstractions:
  cli_argument_parsing:
    applied: true
    notes: "Uses Go's `flag` package for consistent CLI flags: --create-baseline, --verify-baseline, --path, -i, -o, -v."
  error_handling_exit_codes:
    applied: true
    notes: "Exits with 0 on success, 1 on critical errors like invalid arguments, file open failures, or hashing errors. Prints errors to stderr."
  logging_output_format:
    applied: true
    notes: "Uses [INFO] and [ERROR] prefixes for verbose output to stderr, consistent with guide."
  testing_methodology_structure:
    applied: true
    notes: "Manual testing performed with sample input/output, demonstrating baseline creation, modification detection, and deletion detection."
  declarative_tool_metadata:
    applied: true
    notes: "Tool description and usage are in the `README.md` and also as comments in the Go file. Aligns with intent of a metadata block."
  how_it_relates_doc:
    applied: false
    notes: "N/A - This is a Phase 1 tool, not Phase 0."
