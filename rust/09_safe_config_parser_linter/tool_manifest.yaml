# --- Shared Abstractions Application ---
shared_abstractions:
  cli_argument_parsing:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use Rust's `std::env::args` for consistent CLI flags: -c (config file), -s (schema file), -o (output report), -v (verbose)."
  error_handling_exit_codes:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will exit with 0 on success, 1 on parsing/validation errors or file I/O issues. Errors printed to stderr."
  logging_output_format:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use [INFO] and [ERROR] prefixes for verbose output to stderr, consistent with guide."
  testing_methodology_structure:
    applied: false
    notes: "Manual testing with sample input/output will be performed. No formal 'tests/' directory yet per structure."
  declarative_tool_metadata:
    applied: true
    notes: "Tool description and usage will be in the `README.md` and also as comments in the Rust `main.rs` file. Aligns with intent of a metadata block."
  how_it_relates_doc:
    applied: false
    notes: "N/A - This is a Phase 1 tool, not Phase 0."
