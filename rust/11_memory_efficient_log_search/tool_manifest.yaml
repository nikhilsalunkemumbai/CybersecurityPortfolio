# Tool Manifest for: Memory-Efficient Log Search

# --- Metadata ---
name: "Memory-Efficient Log Search"
tool_id: "phase1-rust-11"
phase: 1
category: "Rust"
language: "Rust"
version: "0.1.0"
status: "Validated (Standards)" # Lifecycle: Planned -> In-Progress -> Completed -> Documented -> Tested -> Pushed -> Validated (Standards)

# --- Location & Structure ---
directory: "phase_1/RUST/11_memory_efficient_log_search"

# --- Logic & Purpose ---
purpose: "Searches large log files for patterns (keywords, regex) with a low memory footprint, displaying contextual lines around matches."
core_logic:
  - "Reads log files line by line to minimize memory usage."
  - "Applies string or regular expression matching for specified patterns."
  - "Optionally provides 'before' and 'after' context lines for each match."
  - "Outputs matching lines and context to console or a specified file."

# --- Lifecycle & Version Control ---
lifecycle:
  - event: "Created"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "0.1.0"
    notes: "Initial directory structure and manifest file created."
  - event: "Planned"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "0.1.0"
    notes: "Tool design and purpose defined based on TRACKER.md."
  - event: "Implementation"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "0.2.0"
    notes: "Initial implementation of the core logic in src/main.rs."
  - event: "Testing"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Tool compiled successfully. Tested with sample log files, verifying pattern matching, context display, case sensitivity, and verbose output to file."
  - event: "Completed"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.0"
    notes: "Tool is fully implemented, documented, and tested according to portfolio requirements."
  - event: "Standards Validation"
    date: "2026-01-31"
    version: "1.0.1"
    notes: "Tool's code validated against `PROGRAMMING_STANDARDS.md` and `SHARED_ABSTRACTIONS_CHECKLIST.md`. All standards met, including <=300 lines of code."

# --- Shared Abstractions Application ---
shared_abstractions:
  cli_argument_parsing:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use Rust's `std::env::args` for consistent CLI flags: -i (input file), -p (pattern), -o (output file), -b (before context), -a (after context), -c (case-sensitive), -v (verbose)."
  error_handling_exit_codes:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will exit with 0 on success, non-zero on file I/O errors or invalid arguments. Errors printed to stderr."
  logging_output_format:
    applied: true
    notes: "Will use [INFO] and [ERROR] prefixes for verbose output to stderr, consistent with guide."
  testing_methodology_structure:
    applied: false
    notes: "Manual testing with sample input/output will be performed. No formal 'tests/' directory yet per structure."
  declarative_tool_metadata:
    applied: true
    notes: "Tool description and usage will be in the `README.md` and also as comments in the Rust `main.rs` file. Aligns with intent of a metadata block."
  how_it_relates_doc:
    applied: false
    notes: "N/A - This is a Phase 1 tool, not Phase 0."
